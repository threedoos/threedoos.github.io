      Spiderman is one of the coolest superheroes in the world. His power
      include super strength, ability to climb on walls and he is super smart!
      His best superpower is spidey sense! It allows him to sense attacks and
      danger before they appear.

      Spiderman had a difficult backstory. His Uncle Ben was killed in front of
      his eyes, before he turned into a hero and had power to stop Uncle Ben's
      death. Uncle Ben's dying words, "With great powers, comes great
      responsibility" inspired Spiderman to forever become a noble hero!
